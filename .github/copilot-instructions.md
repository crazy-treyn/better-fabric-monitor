## Instructions
- When running code, always use `wails dev` for development and `wails build` for production builds.
- Before running `wails dev` check to make sure that there isn't already an instance running.
- If you are ever extending or adding new functionality in terms of interacting with the Fabric REST APIs, make sure to use the `microsoftdocs/mcp` and `upstash/context-7` MCP servers.
